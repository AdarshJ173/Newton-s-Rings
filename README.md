## üåà Overview

This interactive simulation brings the classic Newton's rings experiment to life in your terminal. Experience the fascinating interference patterns that occur when light reflects between a plano-convex lens and a flat glass surface, creating concentric colored rings.

The simulation includes a virtual traveling microscope that allows precise measurements of ring diameters, enabling you to experimentally determine the radius of curvature of the lens using the principles of optical interference.

## üî¨ The Physics Behind Newton's Rings

Newton's rings are an interference pattern caused by the reflection of light between a spherical surface and an adjacent flat surface. When light falls on the air gap between these surfaces, some is reflected from the top surface and some from the bottom. 

The optical path difference between these two reflections causes constructive and destructive interference, creating alternating bright and dark rings. The relationship is given by:

```
2Œºt = mŒª
```

Where:
- Œº is the refractive index of the medium in the gap (usually air)
- t is the thickness of the air gap
- m is the order of interference (ring number)
- Œª is the wavelength of light

## üìä Experimental Method

1. Position the microscope at one edge of a ring
2. Take a measurement
3. Move to the opposite edge of the same ring
4. Take another measurement
5. The difference between measurements gives the ring diameter
6. Repeat for multiple rings for better accuracy
7. The radius of curvature (R) can be calculated using: R = (r¬≤‚Çô - r¬≤‚Çò)/[Œª(n-m)]
